        "context": "This process occurs primarily in plant leaves, specifically within chloroplasts. There are two main stages in photosynthesis: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight is absorbed, and energy is stored in the form of ATP and NADPH. The Calvin cycle then uses this energy to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.",
